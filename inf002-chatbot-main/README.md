## Project Requirements

### Creating an Interactive Chatbot with APIs

**Problem statement:**
In this project, you will develop a chatbot using various APIs for text and voice interactions.
You can utilize OpenAI's API or any other suitable APIs for natural language processing, voice,
and multimedia interactions. The project can be extended to include 2D or 3D characters,
scenes, and animations to create a more engaging and interactive experience. This project
will help you learn about API integration, natural language processing, and basic 2D/3D
animation techniques.

### Project Tasks:

**1. Introduction to APIs:**
Learn about different APIs available for text and voice interactions, including OpenAI's API, Google Dialogflow, IBM Watson, etc.
Understand how to authenticate and make API calls.

**2. Setting Up the Development Environment:**
Install necessary libraries (e.g., requests, Pygame, Blender, PyOpenGL).
Set up a Python development environment.

**3. Basic Chatbot Implementation:**
Create a simple chatbot that can respond to user inputs using a chosen text API.
Implement basic conversation handling and response generation.

**4. Voice Integration (Optional):**
Use a voice API (e.g., OpenAI's voice API, Google Cloud Text-to-Speech) to add speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities.
Enable the chatbot to interact with users through voice commands and responses.

**5. 2D Character and Scene Creation (Optional):**
Design a 2D character and background scenes using Pygame or similar libraries.
Animate the character to react to user inputs and chatbot responses.

**6. 3D Character and Scene Creation (Optional):**
Use Blender or PyOpenGL to create a 3D character and environment.
Implement basic animations and actions for the character based on chatbot interactions.

**7. Advanced Features and Customization:**
Add personality and customization options for the chatbot.
Implement more complex conversation flows and handle different user intents.

**8. Testing and Debugging:**
Test the chatbot with various user inputs to ensure it responds correctly.
Debug any issues related to API integration, voice interaction, or animations.
